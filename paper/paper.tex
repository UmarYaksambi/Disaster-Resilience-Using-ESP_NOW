\begin{abstract}
Natural disasters often result in catastrophic failure of communication infrastructure, severely hampering emergency response operations. This paper presents a novel resilient communication framework that operates independently of existing network infrastructure using ESP32-based devices. The system integrates opportunistic mesh networking via ESP-NOW protocol with mobile data mule relays to ensure reliable emergency message delivery. Our hybrid approach employs Time-to-Live (TTL) based controlled flooding for local message propagation and autonomous mobile gateways for collecting messages from isolated areas. The framework incorporates multi-sensor disaster detection capabilities including GPS positioning, seismic activity monitoring, and environmental hazard detection. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 95\% message delivery success rate within 200-meter range and 98\% mobile collection efficiency, proving its effectiveness for post-disaster emergency response scenarios where conventional communication systems have failed.

\section{Introduction}

Natural disasters including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires pose significant threats to human life and infrastructure worldwide. According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, natural disasters affect approximately 350 million people annually, with communication infrastructure failure being a critical factor that exacerbates casualties and delays rescue operations \cite{Hassan2017}.

The vulnerability of existing communication systems during disasters stems from their dependency on centralized infrastructure. Cellular towers, internet backbone connections, and power grids are often among the first casualties in disaster scenarios, creating communication blackouts precisely when emergency coordination is most critical. Traditional emergency communication systems, while robust under normal conditions, fail to provide adequate coverage when their underlying infrastructure is compromised.

Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and low-power wireless communication protocols present new opportunities for developing disaster-resilient communication systems. ESP32 microcontrollers, with their integrated Wi-Fi capabilities and support for the ESP-NOW protocol, offer a promising platform for creating infrastructure-independent communication networks.

This paper presents a comprehensive resilient communication framework specifically designed for disaster scenarios. The system combines opportunistic mesh networking for local area coverage with mobile data mule concepts for extending communication reach to isolated areas. The framework operates entirely without existing infrastructure, making it suitable for deployment in post-disaster environments where conventional systems have failed.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Current emergency communication systems face several critical limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Infrastructure Dependency:} Most systems rely on cellular networks, internet connectivity, or fixed infrastructure that becomes unavailable during disasters.
\item \textbf{Coverage Limitations:} Traditional mesh networks have limited range and cannot bridge large gaps between isolated areas.
\item \textbf{Single Point of Failure:} Centralized architectures create vulnerabilities where failure of key components can disable entire networks.
\item \textbf{Limited Sensor Integration:} Existing solutions often focus solely on communication without incorporating disaster detection capabilities.
\item \textbf{Deployment Complexity:} Many proposed solutions require complex setup procedures that are impractical during emergency situations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implementation of a hybrid communication framework combining opportunistic mesh networking with mobile data mule relay systems
\item Development of a TTL-based controlled flooding mechanism optimized for emergency scenarios
\item Integration of multi-sensor disaster detection capabilities with automated alert generation
\item Implementation of GPS-based location tagging for precise emergency positioning
\item Creation of a real-time monitoring and visualization system for network management
\item Comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrating system effectiveness in simulated disaster scenarios
\item Open-source implementation providing a practical foundation for disaster preparedness initiatives
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

Emergency communication systems for disaster scenarios have been extensively researched, with various approaches addressing different aspects of the challenge.

\subsection{Infrastructure-based Solutions}

Traditional emergency communication systems rely heavily on existing infrastructure. Hassan et al. \cite{Hassan2017} provide a comprehensive survey of IoT applications for disaster management, highlighting both the potential and limitations of infrastructure-dependent solutions. While these systems offer high performance under normal conditions, their dependency on cellular networks and internet connectivity makes them vulnerable during disasters.

Bellido et al. \cite{Bellido2023} proposed a hybrid emergency communication system using Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) and Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) technologies. Their approach demonstrates improved resilience compared to purely cellular-based systems, but still requires partial infrastructure availability, limiting its applicability in complete infrastructure failure scenarios.

\subsection{Opportunistic and Delay-Tolerant Networks}

Opportunistic networking has emerged as a promising approach for disaster communication. Diaz et al. \cite{Diaz2012} evaluated opportunistic networks in disaster environments through simulation studies, demonstrating their effectiveness when traditional infrastructure fails. However, their work primarily focused on theoretical analysis without real hardware implementation or consideration of practical deployment challenges.

Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) have been proposed for scenarios where end-to-end connectivity cannot be guaranteed. While DTNs can handle intermittent connectivity, they typically require sophisticated routing algorithms and may not be suitable for time-critical emergency communications.

\subsection{Mesh Networking Solutions}

Mesh networking technologies offer distributed communication capabilities that can operate without centralized infrastructure. Khan et al. \cite{Khan2022} developed an ESP-MESH based system for air quality monitoring, demonstrating the potential of ESP32 devices for IoT applications. However, their work focused on environmental monitoring rather than emergency communication and did not address the challenges of message propagation in disaster scenarios.

Commercial mesh networking solutions exist, but they are often expensive, require extensive configuration, and may not be suitable for rapid deployment in emergency situations.

\subsection{Mobile Data Mule Systems}

The concept of mobile data mules for message collection and delivery has been explored in various contexts. These systems use mobile nodes to physically carry data between disconnected network segments. While effective for extending network reach, most existing implementations focus on scheduled data collection rather than emergency response scenarios.

\subsection{Gap Analysis}

Despite extensive research, existing solutions have significant limitations for disaster scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item Most infrastructure-based solutions fail when their underlying infrastructure is damaged
\item Opportunistic networks often lack practical implementation guidelines and real-world validation
\item Mesh networking solutions typically have limited range and may not bridge large geographical gaps
\item Mobile data mule systems are often designed for non-emergency applications with relaxed timing requirements
\item Few solutions integrate disaster detection capabilities with communication systems
\end{itemize}

Our approach addresses these limitations by providing a completely infrastructure-free solution that combines the benefits of local mesh networking with mobile data collection, specifically optimized for emergency scenarios.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Overview}

The proposed resilient communication framework employs a hybrid architecture that combines two complementary communication paradigms: local opportunistic mesh networking for immediate area coverage and mobile data mule systems for extending reach to isolated areas. Figure \ref{fig:system_overview} illustrates the overall system architecture.

\subsection{Network Topology and Node Roles}

The framework defines four distinct node roles, each optimized for specific functions within the emergency communication network:

\subsubsection{Sender Nodes}
Sender nodes are the primary data sources in the network, equipped with comprehensive sensor suites for disaster detection and environmental monitoring. These nodes continuously monitor their environment using:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GPS Module (NEO-6M):} Provides precise geographic coordinates for location-based emergency services
\item \textbf{MPU6050 Accelerometer:} Monitors seismic activity through three-axis acceleration measurement with configurable sensitivity thresholds
\item \textbf{MQ-2/MQ-135 Gas Sensors:} Detect hazardous gases including methane, carbon monoxide, and smoke particles
\item \textbf{DHT22 Environmental Sensor:} Monitors temperature and humidity for environmental hazard assessment
\item \textbf{Manual SOS Button:} Enables immediate distress signal activation by users
\end{itemize}

Upon detecting disaster conditions or receiving manual activation, sender nodes create structured SOS packets containing all relevant sensor data and location information. These packets are immediately broadcast via ESP-NOW protocol while simultaneously being stored locally for backup collection by mobile gateways.

\subsubsection{Passive Rebroadcasters}
Passive rebroadcaster nodes extend network coverage by receiving SOS packets from sender nodes and other rebroadcasters, then retransmitting them with controlled flooding mechanisms. These nodes maintain message caches to prevent duplicate transmissions and implement TTL-based forwarding to limit network congestion.

The rebroadcasting algorithm operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Receive incoming message packet
\item Check message ID against local cache
\item If message is new and TTL > 0, decrement TTL and rebroadcast
\item Update local cache with message ID
\item Continue monitoring for new messages
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mobile Gateway Nodes}
Mobile gateway nodes are deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), rescue vehicles, or carried by emergency personnel. These nodes serve as data mules, collecting messages from isolated sender nodes and delivering them to base stations. Mobile gateways implement proximity-based message collection, automatically detecting nearby sender nodes and initiating data transfer when within communication range.

The mobile collection process includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Periodic scanning for sender node beacon signals
\item Automatic proximity detection and connection establishment
\item Bulk transfer of all stored messages from sender nodes
\item Intelligent routing to deliver collected messages to base stations
\item Status reporting and network health monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Receiver Nodes/Base Stations}
Base stations serve as the final destinations for emergency messages, typically located at emergency operations centers, hospitals, or other critical facilities. These nodes are responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Receiving and logging all emergency messages
\item Processing sensor data for threat assessment
\item Integrating with existing emergency response systems
\item Providing real-time visualization and monitoring capabilities
\item Coordinating rescue operations based on received intelligence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Message Structure and Protocol Design}

The communication protocol employs standardized JSON message packets optimized for emergency scenarios. The packet structure balances information completeness with transmission efficiency:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Enhanced SOS Message Packet Structure, label=lst:enhanced_packet]

  },
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "ttl": 3,
  "battery_level": 87.3,
  "signal_strength": -45
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Communication Protocol Stack}

The system leverages ESP-NOW, Espressif's proprietary connectionless communication protocol, as the foundation for all inter-node communication. ESP-NOW provides several advantages for disaster scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Infrastructure Independence:} No requirement for access points or routers
\item \textbf{Low Latency:} Direct peer-to-peer communication with minimal overhead
\item \textbf{Power Efficiency:} Optimized for battery-powered applications
\item \textbf{Reliable Delivery:} Built-in acknowledgment and retry mechanisms
\item \textbf{Wide Compatibility:} Supported across all ESP32 variants
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Algorithms}

\textbf{Disaster Detection Algorithm:}  
The system employs threshold-based detection algorithms for various disaster types:

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{function} \texttt{DetectEarthquake()}
\STATE $acceleration \gets$ \texttt{ReadMPU6050()}
\STATE $magnitude \gets \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2}$
\IF{$magnitude > EARTHQUAKE\_THRESHOLD$}

\ENDIF
\STATE \textbf{return} \texttt{null}
\end{algorithmic}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{TTL-based Flooding Algorithm:}  
The message propagation algorithm implements controlled flooding to balance network coverage with efficiency:

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{function} \texttt{OnMessageReceived($message$)}
\IF{\texttt{IsMessageCached($message.id$)}}
    \STATE \textbf{return} // Duplicate message, ignore
\ENDIF
\STATE \texttt{AddToCache($message.id$)}
\IF{$message.ttl > 0$}
    \STATE $message.ttl \gets message.ttl - 1$
    \STATE \texttt{BroadcastMessage($message$)}
\ENDIF
\STATE \texttt{ProcessMessage($message$)}
\end{algorithmic}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Mobile Collection Protocol:}  
Mobile gateways implement proximity-based collection with optimized timing:

\WHILE{\texttt{true}}
    \STATE $nearbyNodes \gets$ \texttt{ScanForSenderNodes()}
    \FOR{$node$ \textbf{in} $nearbyNodes$}

\item \textbf{Transmission Optimization:} Message buffering and batch transmission reduce radio active time
\item \textbf{Battery Monitoring:} Real-time battery level monitoring with low-power alerts
\end{itemize}

Power consumption analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Active transmission: 180mA average
\item Sensor monitoring: 45mA average  
\item Deep sleep: 8µA average
\item Estimated battery life: 24-48 hours continuous operation
\end{itemize}
